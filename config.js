            description: 'As the program grew so did Waves For Water’s solutions. After addressing the immediate need for clean water, Waves For Water focus on their second phase of disaster relief; addressing the breakdowns in water infrastructure through the creation of large and centrally-located water depots. These are big systems that can serve entire communities, rather than just one household. With new implementations happening daily in Puerto Rico and the Outer Islands Waves for Water implemented water-depot systems, across 116 communities and on 8 islands.',

With 250 nautical miles in front of them, the team set off for the first island in Hurricane Maria’s path, Dominica. The destruction was catastrophic but once on the island Waves for Water was able to reach some of the hardest-hit areas, including the Kalinago Territory.',
